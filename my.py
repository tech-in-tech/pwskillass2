# Q1 How can we store a single quote (â€˜) as a string in a variable?
name = "anubhav'Sharma"

# Q2 Refer the below var1able:
# x = 'a'
# Here, is x a character type or string type variable? Support your answer with an explanation.

'''Here a is string because it is between single quotes
'''


# Q3 Apply the follow1ng functions on this variable: Welcome to Python foundaton course
# 1 = find()
# 2 = count()
# 3 = len()
# 4 = concatination()
# Note: You can use your choice of parameters. But make sure it is correct.
